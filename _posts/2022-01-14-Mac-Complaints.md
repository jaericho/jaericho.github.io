*A list of bugs, complaints, and growing pains from an old Windows user to a new Mac user.*

After some light usage for a few months, here are some of my complaints about MacOS.

* The Activity Monitor is a very poor substitute compared to Task Manager/Resource Monitor.
* Moving files around is much easier with Windows Explorer than Finder.
* I really miss a universal address bar. I'm used to typing `\\servername\sharename` to go anywhere I need.
* OneDrive can take over all the major places in the users' home directory (Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc...); however, iCloud Drive just seems content to exist side by side. This makes it very confusing to know where files exist.
* I have to reboot to fix iCloud Drive not sync'ing a couple times. I think the might be because I have GitHub repos in the iCloud Drive Documents.
* MacOS 12 apparently broke Unraid's TimeMachine hosting capability. I was looking forward to trying that out.
  
*more to come*
