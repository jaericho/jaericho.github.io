[GalCiv3 is #2 on Steam right now.](https://twitter.com/draginol/status/598995115949064193)

I hope it reaches #1.

I'm a fan of pretty much everything [Stardock](https://stardock.com) does and the game is great. My only suggestion would be a clock above the minimap. I need to know how much time I have before I have to go to work because I've stayed up all night playing.
