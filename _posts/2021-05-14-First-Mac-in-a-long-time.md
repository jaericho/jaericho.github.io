My first attempt at moving to the MacOS platform.

The last time I used a Mac was back in the early OSX days with a white iBook. Now, I'm using a coworkers old MacBook Pro (Late 2013). It has a dual core i5 4th Gen cpu, a 13" screen, 8GB of memory, and 256GB of storage. It's a well kept machine. The screen and keyboard are still good condition, the battery is decent for a seven year old battery, and it's running the latest MacOS, [Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/). This is the oldest model to be supported.

After only a day, I'm really enjoying the integration with my iPhone. iMessage and Wi-Fi password sharing, and iCloud are all nice. I'm staying in the iPhone eco system and I'm thinking of getting a Mac to help support my parents with their stuff, but let's see how well this works out...

So let's list my observations and gripes:

* No 'delete' key, only Backspace labeled as Delete. (Altho' I just learned it is Fn-Delete.)
* Different keyboard shortcuts. (I know this is all muscle memory that I'll have to overcome.)
* All these options keys! Control, Option, Alt, Curly-thing, Command, and a Function key. It's too much much. I'd rather see something along the lines of CTRL+x for shortcuts inside programs, and a Meta+x for OS shortcuts.
* Some KB shortcuts are the same: i.e. CTRL+z and Curly+z are both undo. CTRL+s and Curly+s are save. That's very nice.
* ~~Safari has no inspect feature.~~ I found it.
* I immediately started looking for Homebrew to install things from outside the App Store. I would have thought things like VSCode and Github would be there. In fact, I'm surprised at how much stuff isn't in the AppStore.
