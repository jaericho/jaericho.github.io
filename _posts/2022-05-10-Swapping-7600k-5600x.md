Wow, that went smoothly.

I replaced an i5-7600 with a Ryzen 5600x and Windows didn't even bat an eye. I lucked out that it was just the motherboard that died and not the video card. The memory (DDR4-2600) worked as well. I swapped the motherboard and cpu and Windows booted up and everything worked out of the box.

So refreshing from the days of having to rebuild Windows.

Reading [r/linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux) you'd think everyone must reinstall Windows at the first sign of trouble, while I've *literally* had the same install of Windows starting with 7 to 8 to 8.1 to every version of 10.
