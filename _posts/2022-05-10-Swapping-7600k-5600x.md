Wow, that went smoothly.

I built a machine for a friend of mine to barter for some landscape work. He called me up the other day saying it just died on him in the middle of a movie. He lucked out that it was the motherboard that died and not the video card. He wanted to get up and running quickly, so I replaced the i5-7600 with a Ryzen 5600x. I swapped the motherboard and cpu, kept the memory and Windows booted up and everything worked out of the box on the first try.

It's a refreshing change from the days of having to rebuild Windows with a hardware swap.
