Lauren Bacall died yesterday.

I first saw her in [The Big Sleep](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038355/) with Humphrey Bogart. It’s a hell of a movie and she was fantastic in it. She was so sultry and sexy. Key Largo is another great movie of hers. I’ll have to re-watch them both soon.

Bogey and Bacall. You can’t go wrong with that combo.
