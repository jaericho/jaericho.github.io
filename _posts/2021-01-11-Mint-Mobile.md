I finally dumped AT&T.

I finally switched off [AT&T](https://www.att.com) and onto an [MVNO](https://infogalactic.com/info/Mobile_virtual_network_operator). One of those smaller mobile companies that resell one of the Big Three's cellular service. I chose [Mint Mobile](https://www.mintmobile.com/) and they resell [T-Mobile's](https://www.tmobile.com) airwaves.

I first used a trial SIM kit from Mint to get a new number and test out their service and wifi calling. That way I could always use my old AT&T SIM and get back my old service if anything went wrong.

Once I knew it was going to work, the switch was painless. I had one hiccup during the process: When my number was being ported, the process was halted because AT&T wanted a txt confirmation to port my number. I guess I didn't mind that interruption. After that, things went very smoothly and quickly. The whole process took less than 10 minutes.

We'll see how Mint's service and coverage works. I've been on AT&T for many years and I've never had a problem with their service. But I am looking to save some money. It will break my iPhone Upgrade Program, as you have to activate the new phone on one of the Big Three, but even if I hop back to AT&T before upgrading, I'll be saving hundreds of dollars this year, so this hassle might be worth it.

UPDATE: Mint's app blows AT&T's app out of the water. It's clean, uncluttered, fast, and easy to use.

UPDATE 2: I've completed my first month and nothing has changed, and that's exactly what I wanted. I use far less data than I thought, and since my first month, Mint has increased their data plans. The lowest plan went from 3GB to 4GB and that will more than cover my usage. That means I'm dropping down to the lowest plan when my first block of time is up. Thus far, I'm very pleased with Mint Mobile.
