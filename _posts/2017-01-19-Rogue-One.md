I won’t expound on Rogue One. It’s already been hashed to death on the internet, but I will say I enjoyed it.

However, I’m glad that episode 4 was already established. If it wasn’t for episode 4 stating that a lot of people died, I’m sure Hollywood would have saved our heroes and then shoehorned in a pointless romantic subplot.
