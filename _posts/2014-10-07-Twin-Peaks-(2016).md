I'm excited for this.

It looks like Lynch and Frost will be doing a nine episode sequel to the original Twin Peaks and Lynch will be directing all nine. Twin Peaks 2016 will be a continuation of the story and not a reboot. After all the reboots I've seen in the theater and on tv, I'm glad. I'm done with reboots. I don't want to see another one. Another YouTube video said we'll get some answers to some of the questions the cancellation left us with. I hope they don't give us too many answers. The mystery is part of the show.
