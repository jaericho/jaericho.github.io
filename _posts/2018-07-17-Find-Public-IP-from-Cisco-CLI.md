Dealing with ISP modems are a pain. I needed to find out the public ip of a dsl modem after it had changed on me. I was hoping [this](https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/34013/how-to-find-my-public-ip-within-ios) solution would be as simple as it looks and it is.

`more http://ifconfig.me/ip/`

Or if you donâ€™t have DNS configured on the Cisco device:

`more http://153.121.72.212/ip/`
