After watching the excellent Netflix show Daredevil, I was eager to watch the spin-off series, Jessica Jones.

However, it’s classless. It’s horribly written. The dialog is childish. It’s full of terrible modern culture tripe and feminist bullshit. If there’s good in this show, I couldn’t find it.

[A comment](https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/if-youve-been-away-from-tv-or-the-movies-for-a-while/#comment-732199) on a very aptly timed [Chateau Heartiste](https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/if-youve-been-away-from-tv-or-the-movies-for-a-while/) post accurately sums up Jessica Jones:

> Marvel’s new Jessica Jones is adapted by the lady that adapted Twilight. I don’t know if there is a clearer version of a feminist worldview than that, but it hits your entire list in one show, plus some bonuses
> 
> Does Jessica Jones see injustice in the world and decide to use her super powers for good? No she gets raped and the entire miniseries is about her trying to get away from her rapist, and because he is a stalking pyschopath she has to confront him.
