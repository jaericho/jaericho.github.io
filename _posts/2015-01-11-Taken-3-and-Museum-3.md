Apparently, my weekend was filled with trequels(?). I don’t have much on these two, but here goes.

# Taken 3

meh. Not terrible. Kind of a convoluted plot. Action scenes were just blurry messes. At least the daughter character was a completely useless plot point. And it’s still nice seeing Liam Neeson kick ass and not take names. Not Luc Besson’s best work, but I’ve seen worse.

# Night at the Museum 3

meh. It’s a family movie, I’m not the primary demographic, but it was still entertaining. Rental if you have children, or if your girlfriend doesn’t like scary movies, perhaps?
