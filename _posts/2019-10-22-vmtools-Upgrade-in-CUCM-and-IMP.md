*vmtools has a simple upgrade in Ciscoâ€™s CUCM and IM & Presence.*

1. Start the vmtools guest install in interactive mode.
1. `utils os secure permissive`
1. `utils vmtools refresh`
1. (automatic reboot)
1. `utils os secure enforce`

However, if you forget the `utils os secure permissive` command you will receive the following error during bootup and vmtools will not be upgraded: `init: vmware-tools post-stop process terminated with status 1`
