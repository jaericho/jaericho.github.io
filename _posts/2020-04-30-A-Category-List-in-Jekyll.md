*Jekyll is much more powerful than I realize.*

I really just want a static blog that's fast and has nice easy-to-read [typography](http://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/), but I didn't realize how powerful this Jekyll platform could be. Hopefully, I can learn more about it and not get overwhelmed. It looks like it could be quite daunting.

Kudos to Codinfox for making this [easy guide](https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/) on how to create a [Categories page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link categories.md %}).

Up next: tweaking the default theme.
