It seems like every time I install Ubuntu I have to fix something.

For my old Inspiron 6400 itâ€™s usually wifi. It uses a Broadcom wifi chip and I found [these instructions](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1748245&page=5&p=10796508#post10796508) useful in fixing it on Ubuntu 16.04

1. Download the [b43 firmware](http://www.omattos.com/sites/default/files/b43-all-fw.tar_.gz).
1. Copy the folders b43 and b43legacy into /lib/firmware.
1. Reboot
