I found out that Sharknado with the Rifftrax commentary can be bought from [Rifftrax store](http://www.rifftrax.com/rifftrax-live-sharknado).

I only expected to see the audio commentary track there but they have the whole movie. Fantastic! I will definitely be purchasing that and putting it on my [Plex](http://plex.tv/) server.

Remember: Rifftrax Live show of Sharknado 2 on July 9th.
