*The finest in Canadian sarcasm.*

![Corner Gas poster](/assets/2021/10/corner-gas-2004.jpg){:.poster} Recommended to me, [Corner Gas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397138/) is a 30 minute sitcom about a gas station owner in small town Saskatchewan. Quirky characters with heavy doses of sarcasm are a staple of this show. It clean, but it's still funny. The first season starts off a little slow, but with season two it picks up steam and figures out its groove.

Like many sitcoms, I find that some of the minor characters make the show. Hank and Wanda, really make the show. Hank's dumbassery with Wanda's sarcastic wit pairs up nicely.

Corner Gas' creator is [Brent Butt](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0125217/). How much was he teased as a kid? I'm genuinely curious.
