*Ray Garrison, a slain soldier, is re-animated with superpowers.*

# [Bloodshot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1634106/)

![Bloodshot-poster](/assets/2020/03/bloodshot-2020.jpg){:.poster} Nothing will quite top the polish of Marvel superhero movies. They wrote the book on it, perfected the formula until it was so generic they were repeating themselves, and then cranked out so many movies that I'm bored with them now.

Seriously, I'm only looking forward to Dr. Strange 2

But Bloodshot was a decent movie.

It's standard [Vin Diesel](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004874/) action movie, but without the strong family morals of the Fast and Furious movies. (I'm a sucker for those movies.) While it's not terrible, nothing really stands out with Bloodshot, it's just average.

Vin is a super-soldier, re-built with nanites for blood. He's almost invincible and takes quite the beating when he's dishing out revenge for his dead wife.

I enjoyed the twist. The effects were good, and I liked how Vin's super-soldier sidekicks were donning supersuits that still looked technologically plausible and not magical. I'm looking at you Mr. *Iron-Man-nanite-suit-Mark-9000*; however, to be fair, Vin's super powers seem magical.

The action scenes were a bit too choppy for me. They were bordering on shaky cam action and I can't watch that. I was motion sick after watching [Bourne 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372183/).

Vin does a decent job but didn't have much to work with. [Guy Pierce](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001602/) does a good job, but I think he needed to be a bit more menacing.

Overall, Bloodshot was an enjoyable distraction, but it wasn't enough to keep me from checking my email during the movie. 6/10

UPDATE: [Jon Del Arroz](http://delarroz.com/2020/04/20/bloodshot-movie-review-mild-spoilers/) has a good review and more info on the comic's side of things.
