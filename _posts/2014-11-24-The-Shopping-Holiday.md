Apparently, this picture is from a posting from a Toys R'Us. I won't say I've never shopped on black Friday, I have done some online shopping, but I have never and will never go out to a store on black Friday. My family even skipped Christmas gifts last year. We didn't need the hassle or worry of it all. The drive and pressure to *buy-buy-buy* is insane and should be stopped.

Thanksgiving and Christmas would be better served if everyone just went to Church, had a good meal, and moved on.
