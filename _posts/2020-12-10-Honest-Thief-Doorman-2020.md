*One meh and one not so good.*

## [Honest Thief](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1838556/)

*Wanting to lead an honest life, a notorious bank robber turns himself in, only to be double-crossed by two ruthless FBI agents.*

![Honest Thief poster](/assets/2020/12/honest-thief-2020.jpg){:.poster} [Liam Neeson](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000553/) is back! The authorities are chasing him and...wait, I think I've seen this one. Yeah, I  have seen this movie, but I like watching Neeson kick ass so I'll watch it.

The premise is kinda out there, but I'll go with it: Neeson wants to return the money he stole in back robberies in exchange for a reduced sentence because he met a woman *(that's where it lost me)*, but the FBI agents don't take him seriously when he tries to turn himself in. The FBI agents send a couple of junior agents that turn out to be bad and the standard mayhem and commotion commence.

Neeson does a good job, but there isn't much to work with for any one. Even the FBI villain is kind of plain. It's your standard shoot'em up, but it's not terrible. Neeson is still kicking ass. Bad guys are getting their comeuppance. It's all good in the end. IMDB gives it 6.0. That's fair.

Verdict: Watch

## [The Doorman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6222118/)

*A woman returns from combat and befriends a family in NYC. A gang of thieves plot to take the family's valuables, and she is all that stands between them and their lives.*

![The Doorman poster](/assets/2020/12/the-doorman-2020.jpg){:.poster} I like the *trapped-in-a-building-while-fighting-bad-guys* movies. Movies like [The Raid](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1899353/), [Die Hard](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/), and [Dredd](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343727/). So I was intrigued by this one. Plus, it has Jean Reno, so I gotta to see it.

This movie is the penultimate 90lbs. soldier fights bigger, stronger men and wins. [Gina Carano](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2442289/) looks like she could take on almost anyone; however, this wispy [Ruby Rose](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3199307/) looks like she could be blown over by a stiff breeze. IMDB says she was a boxer, okay, she did the movie stunts well, but I don't believe for a moment that she could generate enough momentum to perform the moves in this movie. A couple of them being the completely implausible and much too popular, Black Widow *Wrap-your-legs-around-his-head-and-spin-around-bringing-him-to-the-ground* move.

The premise isn't terrible, and [Jean Reno](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000606/) and [Aksel Hennie](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0377336/) play the villains quite well. But this movie is too predictable and too shallow. IMDB gives it a 4.4, and that's half a point too high.

Verdict: Skip
