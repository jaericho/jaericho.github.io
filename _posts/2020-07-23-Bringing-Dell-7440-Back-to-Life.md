Hold the power button and plug in the laptop without the battery.

I have an older [Dell Latitude E7440](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/latitude-e7440-ultrabook/overview) ultrabook which I am very fond of. There are better laptops out there, smaller and faster, but I just really liked this laptop.

Well the battery developed a bulge, so I removed it. However, the latop also sat for a month or two without use, and I think that messed up the CMOS battery. Because the laptop would not boot at all. No power, no lights flashing, nothing.

I know it should boot on a charger without a battery, and I know the charger is good, so what is going on?

I found you can hold the power button while plugging in the battery will force it to boot and reset the BIOS config.

Kudos to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zpoIlY5OBo) for showing me how. 

It powered up, and I went into the BIOS to redo all my configurations, and the machine booted up.
