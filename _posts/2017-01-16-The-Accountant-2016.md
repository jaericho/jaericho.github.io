*As a math savant uncooks the books for a new client, the Treasury Department closes in on his activities, and the body count starts to rise.*

# [The Accountant](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2140479/)

![pic](/assets/2016/12/theaccountant.jpg){:align="right" width="300px" border="1px"]} The Accountant was an odd movie premise from the start: autistic accountant savant by day, hitman by night...but I was pleasantly surprised that it almost worked. Unfortunately, everything that The Accountant did right, John Wick did better and with more style.

While John Wick setup an interesting underworld with it’s own rules and codes, The Accountant is what? A revenge movie? A hitman with a heart of gold movie? I can’t tell.

All the actors did a good job. J.K. Simmons did a great job and stole the show with his backstory monologue. The little twist at the end to reveal The Accountant's sidekick was cute.

Overall, The Accountant is entertaining. A sequel might be good too, but I’m more looking forward to John Wick 2.

Watch: Yes.
