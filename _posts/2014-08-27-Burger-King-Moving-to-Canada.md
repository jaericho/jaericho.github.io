I'm hearing a lot of commentary with Burger King moving to Canada.

This isn't news to me. Medtronic, based in my home state, recently announced they are moving their legal headquarters to Ireland. Why? Look up it up. They're doing a [Double Irish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish). All the big corporations do it. As the [Cappy Cap](http://captaincapitalism.blogspot.com/2014/08/corporate-taxes-are-dumbest-thing-you.html) is known to say: *Capital flight is a [feature](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/08/27/businesses-move-inversion), not a bug of socialism.* Money seeks the highest return, so it should be no surprise when companies move out the US because of taxes. This is not a surprise to me. If it's a surprise to you, you're a willfully ignorant idiot.

Expect more companies to do this as long as corporate taxes remain high.
