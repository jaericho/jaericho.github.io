*I didn't think I'd care for working from home.*

I don't mind going in the office. I enjoy the routine, my coworkers are nice, and my commute is less than three miles (15 minutes long because of all the lights. ugh). but I must say that three days of working from home and I'm hooked.

Now, I'm one to *work* when I work from home. I know people that *work* from home often and it mostly consists of surfing the web in their pajamas. To toot my own horn, not me. I still do my morning routine, get fully dressed, and even don my security badge. I think that's the key to staying in the working mindset and not getting distracted.

It also helps that I have one set of monitors so when I hook them to my work laptop, I *can't* be distracted by my gaming PC.

Of course, it also helps keep me on track that I've been working on one thing these past couple of days: expanding vpn capacity, so more people can work from home.

Which leads me to: I fucking hate setting up AnyConnect on ASA's. They must be one of the most convoluted, needlessly complex, asininely designed, appliance anywhere. And ASDM is the most horrible, piece of crap, I've ever had the pleasure of working with.

*ASDM: Because UI's should lie to you.*
