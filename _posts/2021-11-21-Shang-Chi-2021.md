*Shang-Chi, the master of weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization.*

![Shang-Chi poster](/assets/2021/11/shang-chi-2021.jpg){:.poster} It's nice that Marvel isn't doing as many origin stories as before. It would get boring if every movie introducing a new character had to be their direct origin story, but then again, just jumping in leaves me lost with these new characters. You still have to introduce them somehow.

So it turns out that [Shang-Chi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9376612/) is more like a superhero's RE-origin story. He *used* to be a villain, and how he's a good guy, but his Dad is still a villain, and he's gotta stop his Dad. *le sigh, more Daddy issues*

Ok that could have worked, but this left me no reason to care about Shang. Ten minutes into the movie and I'm in a big bus fight from out of no where. It just didn't work for me. Everything was very convenient and all the new concepts just didn't jive.

When [Michelle Yeoh](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000706/) is giving the backstory on Ta Lo's magnificent cities, *better than anything you got*, all i'm thinking is... pics or it didn't happen. They kept telling us about the history and the big bad but they never showed us.

The actors did okay. The banter between [Simu Lu](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4855517/) and [Awkwafina](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5377144/) was fun. [Ben Kingsly](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001426/) was hilarious. But [Tony Chiu-Wai Leung](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504897/) wasn't villainous enough, but that's because he didn't have anything to work with. This guy is supposed to be the biggest warlord in the world over the course of thousands of years, well then make him a villain!

I think it would have worked better if it was more about Shang's dad and his redemption arc: He's evil. Wife made him good. Wife dies. He's sad and goes back to evil. His kids bring him back from the Dark side, uh I mean evil side. I would have liked to have seen more of that. Instead he's listening to voices that the audience doesn't know anything about oh and it just happens to be the big bad.

So what the movie was telling instead of showing, and what they were telling, the audience could just guess anyways.

The martial arts were good. In some scenes very hard Wushu. In other scenes soft tai chi stuff. Altho' it still suffers from 90 lbs. woman knocking over 250 lbs man, and I must keep reminding myself that physics don't matter in a Marvel movie.

Not Marvel's best, but it probably won't be their worst. It could have been good and they're building up a new overarching story with the tie-in at the end. Hopefully that will be good. But the execution this time around just didn't work.

Watch: If you're a MCU fan.

Re-watch: Probably not.

IMDB gives is 7.8. That is way too high.

<small>*TBH, I preferred the new [GI Joe: Snake Eyes]({% post_url 2021-08-22-Snake-Eyes-2021 %}) movie. SHHH!*</small>
