Tolerance, Equality, Progress, Inclusiveness, and Diversity

> And then I’ll explain to you, very slowly and in words of not more than five syllables, that those hard-nosed, buck-chasing “businessmen” are observably losing literal billions as they continue to tear away at the foundations of Western Civilization: Christianity, the family, the rule of law, and the white race in the name of Tolerance, Equality, Progress, Inclusiveness, and Diversity.

Vox Day has a [great post](https://voxday.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-cost-of-sjw-convergence.html) about ESPN loosing billions in the name of T.E.P.I.D. I’m going to steal that phrase. It just fits so well.
