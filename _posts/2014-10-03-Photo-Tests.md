Here is an example of a low(er) light photo with HDR on an [iPhone 6 Plus](https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/cameras/).

The lights weren't too low, but they were much lower than what I would have liked with my iPhone 4S. The focus is incredibly fast and I'm the optical stabilization will help me out a lot. I was constantly retaking blurry pics on my 4S because I'd shake the camera.

So far, I'm quite impressed.

My favorite beer.
