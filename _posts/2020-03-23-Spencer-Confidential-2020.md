![Spencer Confidential (2020)](/assets/2020/03/spencer-confidential-2020.jpg){:.poster} If it stars Mark Wahlberg, I **gotta** see it... Well, not really. Some of his action/comedies, like [The Other Guys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386588/), I found hysterical, but Spencer Confidential didn't quite hit the mark for me. For what was billed as an action/comedy, it wasn't serious enough to be an action movie, and it wasn't funny enough to be laugh-out-loud.

The character development wasn't enough either. I didn't have enough backstory on any of the other characters to really figure out how this group fit together. Even Wahlberg's character never really lets on to why he's playing do-gooder all the time.

And the comedy part felt like it was a mashup of a bunch of ideas that didn't fit together. I think this is how the movie was written:

>--"Let's give the main character a really crazy girlfriend."
>
>--"Oh, and let's make her a dog groomer and boarder as well. Like give her 20 dogs in her house."
>
>--"Why?"
>
>--"I dunno. Let's make the main character a dog lover. That way it's more tension between him and the crazy-ex."

*Umm, what?*

Some of the one-liners were funny, but nothing really felt like it all fit together.

Overall, it wasn't bad. I was entertained; however, I don't think there was enough character development, the jokes didn't seem to jive, and at 1:51, it felt fifteen minutes too long for what it was. IMDB currently rates it at 6.2. That's more than fair.
