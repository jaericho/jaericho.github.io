I upgraded to Windows 10 via Team Viewer and it worked!

So far Iâ€™m happy with 10. The upgrade went smoothly,  I only had one BSOD, but I think that was caused by nvidia drivers. I have since upgraded to those drivers and everything is working fine. I do wish MS would make the OS a bit more consistent in terms of menus and control panels etc., (Those complaints have been well documented.) but I think they are getting better.
