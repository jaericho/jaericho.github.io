Season 2 went downhill, rapidly.

The first season of [My Life is Murder](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10584446/) with [Lucy Lawless](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005128/) was pretty entertaining, but season 2 took a turn for the worse. Every episode has some verbal troll. Denigrating men, supporting transgender lies calling men women, and supporting feminism. I didn't think that Lucy Lawless's character was terrible the first season, but perhaps I missing something. This season her character is a terrible person. She is constantly mean and angry.

I liked the first season, it's too bad this one went downhill. Lawless is a good actor and I enjoy watching her work, but not this show. I will skip season three.
