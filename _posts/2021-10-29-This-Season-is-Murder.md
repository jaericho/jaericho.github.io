*Season 2 went downhill, rapidly.*

The first season of [My Life is Murder](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10584446/) with [Lucy Lawless](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005128/) was pretty entertaining, but season two took a turn for the worse. Every episode includes some verbal tirade about feminism, gays, transgenders, or climate change. The characters are on a never-ending feminist power trip and constantly denigrating men. I didn't think that Lucy Lawless's character was terrible the first season, but perhaps I missed something. This season, her character is mean, angry, and very unlikable.

I liked the first season, so it's too bad this season went downhill. Lawless is a good actress, and I enjoy watching her work, but for this show, I'll skip season three.
