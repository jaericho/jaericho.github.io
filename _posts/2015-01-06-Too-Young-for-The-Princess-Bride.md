From a [WSJ article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/aaron-rodgerss-hardest-catch-his-jokes-1420482041) about Aaron Rodgers’ wit:

> Then there is Rodgers’s habit of quoting “The Princess Bride.” While the 1987 romantic comedy is widely considered a classic, the allusions are lost on Rodgers’s 20-something teammates. (At 31, Rodgers is older than all but three guys on the team.) His favorite line to blurt out, he said, is from the character Vizzini: “Let me put it this way. Have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates? Morons.”
> 
> “They probably don’t get the reference, no,” Rodgers said.

This is a sad day for America when The Princess Bride references can’t be identified.
