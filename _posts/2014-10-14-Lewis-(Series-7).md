I saw the premier of series 7 for Lewis. I liked it.

I was a little bummed out when Lewis retired at the end of last season. I thought I would have to rely upon [Endeavour](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2039333/) to fullfil my Oxford mystery quota. I never followed up to find out of series 7 was greenlit or not. Thinking it was cancelled, I had a pleasant surprise when Roku sent me an email saying that series 7 started on PBS.

I've liked Lewis from the start. The dynamic between he and Hathaway are great. Lewis, the common-man inspector in the hoity-toity Oxford is a fish out of pond. He often relies on his educated, yet not naive, Hathaway to fill in the gaps of this knowledge. It's a partnership that worked. However, now Lewis has moved into retirement and Hathaway is the Inspector with a new sidekick. I won't be giving anything away by saying that Lewis is still in the show. He's now a consultant to the department. Maybe it's just a transition period. I don't think Lewis can stay on the show if they are going to have a new partner for Hathaway, but I guess we'll see how it pans out.

The episode was good. Hathaway and Lewis are in fine form. The writers need to find the new partner's character soon.

Update 2014-10-18: I saw the second episode of this season and it was very good. I almost felt sorry for the murderer. He was cuckolded twice. But he did murder three people. It was a crazy episode. It also seems that Lewis is staying in the show. I'm glad. More Lewis and Hathaway is always a good thing.
