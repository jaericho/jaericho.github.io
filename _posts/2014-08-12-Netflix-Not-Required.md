Vox has a hilarious set of posts up at his blogs, [Vox Populi](http://voxday.blogspot.com/2014/08/would-be-salon-writer-visits-alpha-game.html) and [AlphaGamePlan](http://alphagameplan.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-woman-inquires-about-game.html).

TL;DR: A man asks a Druish princess out. She friendzone's him and proceeds to invite him back to her place to chat and a bottle of wine. He makes his move a second time and she rebuffs. He leaves. She accuses him of a temper tantrum and wonders why he left. She asks Vox about it. He gives her 100 ABV Truth. Her feminist reaction is old and predictable, yet still entertaining. Even the [hapless suitor](http://alphagameplan.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-other-side.html) replies to Vox.

I don't think I need to watch TNT anymore. There is a enough drama and entertainment on the internet. This could really help me save money.
