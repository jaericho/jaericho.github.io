George Jetson, the current point leader for the league, graciously passed along some racing tips to the rest of us slowpokes for tonight’s racing...how thoughtful. /s

> In an effort to help you all gain some speed at tonight’s race(s), I’ve put together a list of ways to shed some weight (since we are all running under weight restrictions).
> 
> 1. Get a haircut – that’s right hippy boy, I’m talking to you.
> 1. Remove any dead weight, watches, Chinese throwing stars, cell phones, nunchucks, keys, brass knuckles
> 1. Wear clean underwear – seriously people, I shouldn’t even have to suggest this one.
> 1. Remove any excess lint from your navel.
> 1. Think about switching out your hoop piercings for studs (better aerial dynamics mean less drag).
> 1. Much like horses at a race, nope, not going to even go there.
> 1. I hope you each find at least two or three of the above suggestions helpful. Also do not hesitate to pass along any I may have missed.
> 
> Good luck tonight and drive safe.
