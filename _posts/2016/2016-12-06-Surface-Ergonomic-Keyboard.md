I bought a [Surface Ergonomic Keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/accessories/surface-ergonomic-keyboard) the other day and I’m quite pleased.

# Features
The media keys work! No need for remapping. That was a not-so-minor annoyance with using the Apple Keyboard with Windows: several missing keys, no media keys, and the need to remap something if you really wanted it. It wasn’t a deal breaker for me because I like the feel of the keyboard and it’s very easy to type on, but it’s nice to have media keys back.

The only issue with having media keys is now I have to toggle for Function keys. I do use F2 (rename) and F5 (refresh). But there is a toggle switch so you can choose which keys will be the default.

There are media keys for mute, vol up, vol down, prev, play/pause, next, bright up, bright down, magnifier, multitask, connect to devices, settings, calculator, minimize all, notifications, and lock.

Bluetooth is built in so there is no dongle. The keyboard runs off of two AAA batteries. Pairing it up with Windows 10 was a breeze.

The ergonomic keyboard has a bit more heft to it than the regular keyboard. It’s a good weight. I prefer keyboards have a bit of mass to them. I don’t want it moving around on my desk.

# Aesthetics
The keyboard looks great. It’s all various shades of grey. The palm rest for the ergonomic keyboard has a nice feel to it. MS says it’s easy to clean but I’m just leery about a cloth palm rest. It’s some fancy Italian fabric. Soft, and padded a bit. The cloth palm rest is the only thing I’m leery about with this keyboard.

# Nitpicks
* The lights to indicate the capslock, num lock, etc. are a little dim or small.
* The shift key next to the Z is a bit small too. Altho’ it could be that I’ve not used an ergonomic keyboard in a long time.
* A bit spendy at $130, but if it holds up as well as a mechanical keyboard then it’s worth it.
None of these are deal breakers.

# Conclusion
I’m still testing out the ergonomic version. I’m tempted to go back and get the regular version, since I use a regular mechanical keyboard at work.

I heartily recommend this keyboard. What little time I’ve spent with it I can say it’s a great keyboard. It’s a little spendy, but if you like the Apple keyboard style with perfect Windows (Win8, 8.1, 10. No Win7) integration, this keyboard is great.
