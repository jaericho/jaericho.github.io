I may be called “The Bulldozer” from now on. Not because I work for a heavy equipment dealership, but because I allegedly tried to bulldoze my way through the rest of the racers. I think the video footage will show differently… ok, not really, I did try to bulldoze my way through. I'm not ashamed. They wouldn't get out of my way.

Infineon is a brutal track. It's slow with lots of turns which makes it very difficult to pass. It seems that only the top, coming out of the little chicane is best spot.
