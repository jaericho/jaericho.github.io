I was having issues installing some HP Universal x64 print drivers. The wizard would fail with an `0x0â€¦57` error. Also `pnputil -e` would fail with an _Enumeration of driver packages failed: Access is denied_ error.

The fix was to login with another admin account, then the drivers installed successfully.
