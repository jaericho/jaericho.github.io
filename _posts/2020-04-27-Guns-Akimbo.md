This movie is a strange mix of modern trolling culture and mindless shoot'em ups.

![Guns Akimbo poster](/assets/2020/04/guns-akimbo-2019.jpg){:align="right" height="300px" border="1px"} ~~Harry Potter~~ Daniel Radcliffe* is a cubicle drone at an programming company that make crappy cell phone "games" that just make you tap the screen to advance and charge you money. On the side, he likes to drink beer and virtue signal to the dregs of the internet. The lastest craze is an underground fight club called Skizm. Skizm finds our keyboard hero and bolts guns to his hands to make him fight to the death another Skizm victim. *(It sounds like they're trying to put a message in this movie.)*

Daniel Radcliffe does a good job as our *I-Dont-Wanna-Be-The-Hero* hero. The villian is psychodically evil but unfortunately empty, and luckily for us they avoided what would have been an easily contrived yet forced romantic subplot between Radcliffe and [Weaving](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3034977/).

However, even though the movie is billed as an action/comedy, there were never any laugh out loud moments. Maybe some chuckles and definitely some rolling eyes, but no real funny comedy. The action was over the top at times (so is the premise) but I think still suffers from the impossible hit trope. People don't keep fighting after getting hit with a hammer in the head...**three times**.

As far as braindead entertainment movies go, this one is okay. Everything seemed to fit together but something was just 15 degrees off and I can't put my finger on it.

Watch: maybe. Buy: no.

*I must apologize to Radcliffe. I couldn't think of his name. all I could think of is Harry Potter.
