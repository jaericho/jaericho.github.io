After taking over several Aruba Instant swarms, I lost the pre-share WPA passkey to a wireless network.

Luckily, in InstantOS I could still see the key unencrypted with this enable mode command:

    sh run no-encrypt

Other blog posts said to use:

    encrypt disable
    sh run

However, that didnâ€™t work for me. That may only be for the full controller.
