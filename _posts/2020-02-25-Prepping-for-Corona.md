I've looked at some of these suggestions and I think they are worth implementing.

If nothing else, Corona might get me to look at preparedness a bit more. I've been slacking in my Boy Scout "Be Prepared" efforts.

> Almighty God, please stop this disease. Give comfort to the dying and grieving, and forgive us our sins. In the name of your son, our Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.

I think the goal will be to stock up enough to easily limit my public exposure for several weeks.

From [Vox Popoli](http://voxday.blogspot.com/2020/02/prepping-for-corona-chan.html):

* Try to get ahead on medical prescriptions when you can, in case of very predictable supply chain disruptions, and so you won’t have to go out to the pharmacy at a time when there may be long lines of sick people.
* Start to stock up on enough non-perishable food to last your household through several weeks of social distancing at home during an intense wave of transmission in the community.
* Take your kids out of school and activities. There is no need to freak anyone out; what kid doesn't enjoy a snow day? Handle it right and they'll be happily saying "thank you, Corona-chan!"
* Cancel all unnecessary social engagements. As one friend said, it's a good time to spend the evenings kicking back and having margaritas with your wife.
* Get permission to work from home. Most businesses will embrace this and those who are most proactive about it will get permission first.

[More Suggestions](https://virologydownunder.com/past-time-to-tell-the-public-it-will-probably-go-pandemic-and-we-should-all-prepare-now/):

* We may have a window of opportunity now to make some practical preparations. We must make the most of it – even though the effort may be wasted if a severe pandemic doesn’t happen.
* What matters most is how households, neighborhoods, community groups, and businesses prepare.
* Individual and community preparations will focus on three tasks – reducing each person’s chance of getting sick, helping households with basic survival needs during a pandemic, and minimizing and coping with larger societal disruption.
* Social distancing will be important but unpleasant.
* School closings present a particularly difficult social distancing dilemma.
* Hand-washing is far from a panacea. But it’s easy, it’s under your control, and it has no significant downside.
* Like washing your hands, wearing a facemask may help a bit. But it has more downside than washing your hands.
* Getting ready for a pandemic is largely about preparing for possible shortages.
* It’s probably too late to stockpile much now, but do what you can.
* Now is also the time to think about how you will care for loved ones at home.
* To get ourselves through the hard times that may be coming, we will need volunteers. How can you help?
