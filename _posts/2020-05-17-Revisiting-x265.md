I thought I knew what I was doing with Handbrake encoding. I've been proven wrong.

And now I don't know what to think... I thought for the longest time that video encoding with [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) was a fairly simple trade off of *Quality, Speed, and Filesize: Pick Two*. So I would choose the best reasonable quality for the video, and encode as slowly as reasonable to get the smallest filesize. But after some testing I have to throw that thinking all out.

I recently bought the [Daredevil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3322312/) blu-ray and decided to rip them with [x265](https://infogalactic.com/info/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) as my Plex server is more powerful for transcoding and more of my client devices can do x265.

For the tests, I started with the built-in preset of `H.265 MKV 1080p30` and just adjusted it closer to my settings:

* Removed the deinterlace filters.
* Removed the audio (I'm just interested in filesize results of the video encoding.)
* Set the framerate to variable + Same as Source.
* The preset also included `strong-intra-smoothing=0:rect=0:aq-mode=1`, so I kept those settings.
* Then I just re-encoded the same chapter at different speeds.

Here are some tests of Daredevil S01E01 Chapter 3:

I have no idea how or why *increasing* the encoding speed consistantly results in the smaller filesize, but it does.

I encoded the entire season with these settings and I like the results. They look much better than the previous copy I had at 720p. The average filesize is 1.2GB and about 400MB of that is audio. (AAC Quality 8, although redoing the DTS-MA track in FLAC and audio track goes from 1GB to ~450MB, so for not much more filesize I could get lossless audio at half the size.)
