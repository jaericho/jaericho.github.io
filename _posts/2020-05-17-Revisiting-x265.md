I thought I knew what I was doing with Handbrake encoding, but now I don't know what to think...

UPDATE: [This StackExchange question](https://superuser.com/questions/1556953/why-does-preset-veryfast-in-ffmpeg-generate-the-most-compressed-file-compared) might explain what I am seeing with these tests. *tl;dr: CRF is not **true** constant quality.*

I always thought video encoding followed the simple formula of **Quality, Speed, Filesize: Pick Two**. So I would choose the best, reasonable quality setting for the video and encode as slowly as reasonable to get the smallest filesize. However, after some testing with x265 I have to throw all that thinking out the window.

I recently bought the [Daredevil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3322312/) Season 1 blu-ray and decided to rip them with [x265](https://infogalactic.com/info/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) as my Plex server is [more powerful]({% post_url 2014-11-13-x265 %}) for transcoding and more of my client devices can do x265 natively.

I used [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) for the tests, and I started with the built-in preset of `H.265 MKV 1080p30` and then adjusted it closer to my normal settings:

* Removed the de-interlace filters.
* Removed audio tracks for the tests.
* Set the framerate to `Same as Source/variable`.
* The preset also included `strong-intra-smoothing=0:rect=0:aq-mode=1`, so I kept those settings.

Then I just re-encoded the same chapter at different speeds.

Here are the results for Daredevil S01E01 Chapter 3 (11 minutes):

I have no idea how or why *increasing* the encoding speed consistently results in the smaller filesize, but it does.
