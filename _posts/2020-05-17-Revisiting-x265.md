I thought I knew what I was doing with Handbrake encoding. I've been proven wrong.

And now I don't know what to think... I thought for the longest time that video encoding with [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) was a fairly simple trade off of *Quality, Speed, and Filesize: Pick Two*. So I would choose the best reasonable quality for the video, and encode as slowly as reasonable to get the smallest filesize. However, after some testing I have to throw all that thinking out.

I recently bought the [Daredevil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3322312/) blu-ray and decided to rip them with [x265](https://infogalactic.com/info/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) as my Plex server is more powerful for transcoding and more of my client devices can do x265.

For the tests, I started with the built-in preset of `H.265 MKV 1080p30` and just adjusted it closer to my settings:

* Removed the deinterlace filters.
* Removed the audio for the tests.
* Set the framerate to variable + Same as Source.
* The preset also included `strong-intra-smoothing=0:rect=0:aq-mode=1`, so I kept those settings.
* Then I just re-encoded the same chapter at different speeds.

Here are the results for Daredevil S01E01 Chapter 3:

I have no idea how or why *increasing* the encoding speed consistantly results in the smaller filesize, but it does.

I encoded the entire season with these settings and I like the results. They look much better than the previous copy I had at 720p. The average filesize is 1.2GB and about 400MB of that is audio.

For audio I usually do [AAC](https://infogalactic.com/info/Advanced_Audio_Coding) (Quality 8) and that made S01E01's audio track 406MB. Re-encoding the DTS-MA track in [FLAC](https://infogalactic.com/info/FLAC) would make the audio track 450MB, so for not much more filesize I could get lossless audio. I'll need to see what my client devices do with FLAC. This also means that AAC Quality 8 might be overkill on the bitrate, but I can't find any good info on the quality settings for AAC in Handbrake.
