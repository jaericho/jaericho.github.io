I thought I sort of knew what I was doing with Handbrake encoding. I've been proven wrong.

I thought for the longest time that video encoding with [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) was a fairly simple trade off of *Quality, Speed, and Filesize: Pick Two*. So I would choose the best reasonable quality for the video, and encode as slowly as reasonable to get the smallest filesize. But after some testing I have to throw that thinking all out.

I recenty bought the [Daredevil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3322312/) blu-ray and decided to rip them with x265 as my Plex server is more powerful for transcoding and more of my client devices can do x265.

Here are some tests of Daredevil S01E01 Chapter 3.

For the tests, I started with the built-in preset of `H.265 MKV 1080p30` and just adjusted it closer to my settings:

* Removed the deinterlace filters.
* Removed the audio (I'm just interested in filesize results of the video encoding.)
* Set the framerate to variable + Same as Source.
* Then I just re-encoded the same chapter at different speeds.

I have no idea how or why increasing the encoding speed results in the smaller filesize, but it does.
