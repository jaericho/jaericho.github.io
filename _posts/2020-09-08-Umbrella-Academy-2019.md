*A family of former child heroes, now grown apart, must reunite to continue to protect the world.*

![Umbrella Academy Poster](/assets/2020/09/umbrella-academy-2019.jpg){:.poster}The Umbrella Academy is a graphic novel adaptation based on *let's-make-the-X-Men-a-dysfunctional-family.* Then [Netflix (pox be upon them)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9196192/) latched on to it and made the angsty, bitter, millennial X-Men.

Seven adopted kids. Six kids have superpowers, one kid does not. *(I bet she's the most powerful but her powers are hidden.)*

The woman without powers is picked on by everyone her whole life so she's very bitter. *(I bet she's the [Dark Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Phoenix_Saga).)*

The woman without powers finally meets a really nice guy. He's so accommodating and normal. *(I bet he's evil and just using her for her hidden powers.)*

All while there is a countdown to the apocalypse. *(I bet the woman without powers is involved.)*

I'm not trying to crap on the whole thing. It was entertaining, well acted, had high production value, and there were a few twists I didn't see coming. However, I did guess all the major plot points correctly. *(and if I guessed them, they were obvious.)*

I didn't guess the ending 100%, but I was correct that it was going to be a cop out. *But I knew there was going to be a season two so, that was a big hint.*

Watch: Season 1, yes. Season 2, eh maybe.

Did I mention there is time travel? I hate time travel.
