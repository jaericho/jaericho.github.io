*A family of former child heroes, now grown apart, must reunite to continue to protect the world.*

![Umbrella Academy Poster](/assets/2020/09/umbrella-academy-2019.jpg){:.poster}The Umbrella Academy is based on a graphic novel which was probably based off of the idea that the authors could make a dysfunctional family X-Men. Netflix (pox be upon them) decided to make angsty, bitter, millennial X-Men.

Seven adopted kids. Six kids have superpowers, one kid does not. *I bet she's the most powerful but her powers are hidden.*

The woman with out powers finally meets a really nice guy. He's so accommodating and normal. *I bet he's evil and just using her for her hidden powers.*

The one girl without powers is picked on by everyone so she's very bitter. *I know, she's the [Dark Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Phoenix_Saga).*

I'm not trying to crap on the whole thing. It was entertaining, well acted, and had high production value; and there were a few twists I didn't see coming. However, I did guess all the major plot points correctly. *and if I guessed them, they were obvious.*

I didn't get the ending 100%, but I was correct that it was going to be a cop out. *But then again I knew there was going to be a season two so that was a big hint for me.*

Watch: Season 1, yes. Season 2, eh maybe.
