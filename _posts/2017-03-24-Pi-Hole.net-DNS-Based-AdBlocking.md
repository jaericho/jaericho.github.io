[Pi-hole.net](https://pi-hole.net/) is a fun little weekend project.

I set it up as a VM and set my DHCP server to use it as the DNS server and whammo! insta-adblocking.

# GOOD
* Easy to install and setup. (Walk through the wizard to install, then change your DHCP server to use Pi-hole as your DNS server.)
* Fast and small. (Well, it was designed to run on a Raspberry Pi.)
* Nice GUI and reports.
* Effective.
* Fun little weekend project.

# ~~BAD~~ WISHLIST
There is nothing bad, but I wish it would run under [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/). The [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) server I spun up is terribly large.

# RESULTS
Pi-hole.net doesn’t block everything that [uBlock](https://ublock.org/) does, but it does catch an extra 3% more ads than without uBlock (according to the sites I visit), and it will help all the tablets and phones on your network that don’t have uBlock.
