I'm new to working from home, but I quickly realized there are required habits to make this work.

[This article](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/remote-work-discipline) outlines some very good tips for working from home and not being a slacker.

Here's what I learned in the past couple weeks. Many of them align with the above article:

1. **Dress like you're in the office.** - Put your security badge if it helps keep you focused.
2. **Continue with your normal schedule.** - If you work from 8-5, then continue that routine.
3. **Leave the TV off.** - You don't have TV in the office, so don't put it on at home during working hours. If you have a small radio on at work, then go ahead and have a small radio on at home.
4. **Take breaks.** - My first couple days working from home I took no breaks and I was burning myself out. Take your breaks the same you do at work.
5. **Don't do chores.** - It's tempting to put in a load of laundry or straighten the kitchen but don't unless you can legitimately fit it in on your breaks.
6. **Track your progress.** - I keep a notepad with a list of tasks to do and things accomplished. It helps keep me focused.

When it comes to working from home I think most of these can be summed up very simply: **What you do at work, do at home.**
