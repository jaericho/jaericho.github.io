The videos are up for week two of the George Jetson League 2014 at ProKart Indoor Racing.

We all were much rougher out on the track this week. There was a lot of bumping and trading paint, and the crash in the third race (@3:00) let me squeak by and take 2nd place. Luckily I was in a great kart (#9) with good acceleration and I was able to keep 2nd place.
