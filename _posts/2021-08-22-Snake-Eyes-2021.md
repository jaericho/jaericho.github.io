*A legendary warrior. His epic origin story.*

No, not the [Nicholas Cage movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120832/). This is a serious entry in the GI Joe Cinematic Universe.

![Snake Eyes GI Joe Origins poster](/assets/2021/08/snake-eyes-2021.jpg){:.poster} [Snake Eyes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8404256/) is better than the previous [GI Joe movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1046173/), but since it's an origin story you know exactly where it's going. One thing I did like was that the writers didn't explain ALL of the Snake Eye's mythos. His vow of silence (or mutism, I dunno anything about it really) isn't explained, and I think that is a very good thing. Could they squeeze in another prequel to explain that tidbit? Sure. Should they? No.

IMDB gives it a 5.7. That is one point too high.

Watch: If you didn't want your time back after watching the GI Joe movies, sure. If you are drunk on Friday night with friends, maybe. Otherwise, wait for the [Rifftrax](https://www.rifftrax.com/).
