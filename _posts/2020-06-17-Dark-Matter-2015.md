Rough edges keep this show from being really good.

![Dark Matter poster](/assets/2020/06/dark-matter-poster.jpg){:.poster} **Spoiler alert:** the 2015 SciFi[^1] show, [Dark Matter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4159076/), ends on a big cliffhanger.

Ok, now that we have that spoiler out of the way. I think this show was pretty descent. It starts out a little rough and needed some polish, but overall it had some good sci-fi concepts, the characters weren't too trope-ish as to be annoying, the effects were good, and the universe was interesting.

The pacing is a bit quick. A lot is covered in each episode, and there isn't too much unnecessary filler.

It does suffer from the *I'm-a-badass-woman-hear-me-roar* trope a bit. But that is to be expected by a mainstream channel in 2015. The show cloaks it with nanites and robots, but there were eyerolling moments.

And some of the technology felt a bit too convenient. My complaints were the fact that the super, universe changing, ship engine is a briefcase with 8 credit cards. Well that's makes it easy to shlep around, steal, and install where ever they want at a moments notice. Second, the Transit Pods are a great idea and make for interesting plot points, but creating a clone and dumping someone's consciousness into it across the galaxy only takes seconds. I don't buy it. I think biology would be a little more restrictive.

Those are relatively minor gripes. The political intrigue in the Empire and between the Corps is good. There's no real filler episodes to slug through. Overall, not bad.

Watch: Yes.

Rewatch: Probably not.

Wishing for a season 4 to properly resolve the cliffhanger: Absolutely.

[^1]: I won't type out it's current spelling. That's just stupid.
