*Rough edges keep this show from being really good.*

![Dark Matter poster](/assets/2020/06/dark-matter-poster.jpg){:.poster} **Spoiler alert:** the 2015 SciFi show, [Dark Matter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4159076/), ends on a big cliffhanger.

Ok, now that we have that spoiler out of the way. I think this show was pretty decent. The beginning is a little rough and needs some polish, but overall it has some good sci-fi concepts, the characters are interesting and not too trope-ish as to be annoying, the effects were good, and the universe was interesting.

The pacing is quick. A lot is covered in each episode, and there isn't too much unnecessary filler.

It does suffer from the *I'm-a-badass-woman-hear-me-roar* trope a few times. But that is to be expected by a mainstream channel in 2015. The show cloaks it with nanites, robots, and these-are-the-baddest-bad-guys-of-the-galaxy, but there were eye-rolling moments.

Another nitpick is some of the technology felt a bit too convenient. The super-awesome, universe-changing, ship engine that makes us nigh-invulnerable is a briefcase and eight credit cards. That sure makes it easy to steal, schlep around, and install whereever they need to at a moment's notice.

Second, the Transit Pods are a great idea and make for interesting plot points and situations, but creating a clone and dumping someone's consciousness into it across the galaxy only takes seconds. I don't buy it. I think biology would be a little more restrictive.

Those are relatively minor gripes. The political intrigue in the Empire and between the Corporations is good. There are no real filler episodes to slug through. Overall, not bad.

Watch: Yes.

Rewatch: Probably not.

Wishing for a season 4 to properly resolve the cliffhanger: Absolutely.
