Based on Disneyland's theme park ride where a small riverboat takes a group of travelers through a jungle filled with dangerous animals and reptiles but with a supernatural element. *There's no tagline?*

![Jungle Cruise Poster](/assets/2021/12/jungle-cruise-2021.jpg){:.poster}[Jungle Cruise](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/) seems to be the love child of writers that wanted to combine [The Mummy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/) and [Pirates of the Caribbean](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/), and it almost worked.

*Almost.*

Unfortunately, nothing about this movie sticks out. The Mummy has more adventure and doesn't slog along, and Pirates had a romping score to go along with the swashbuckling and crazy Johnny Depp we all love. But Jungle Cruise doesn't quite pull it off: the story takes too long to get going, the effects are all CGI, and while they don't look *too* bad, it's still noticeable, and some of the stunts are a little too implausible. *(Jumping a boat over a dock. Um, no.)* The writing just wasn't tight enough.

[The Rock](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0425005/) and [Emily Blunt](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289434/) do fine jobs. They have good chemistry together. And you're watching a movie with The Rock, he's going to play "The Rock", and you'll enjoy it like every other movie you've seen with "The Rock".

But for all the good points, it just adds up to mediocre.

And then there is the usual woke BS. The comedy relief character is a stereotypical effeminate, gay man, playing the coward. The character could have been a wimp who learns to stick up for himself without the sexual angle. The audience didn't need to know that his "interests" lay elsewhere because it's not relevant to the story. The only romance in the story is between the characters of The Rock and Emily Blunt.

And then there was the dig at the patriarchy: The cannibal tribe in the Amazon has a woman for a chief, but after jumping a riverboat over a dock [Fast and the Furious](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5433138/) style, I didn't even blink at the cannibal tribe chief being a woman. Her English accent was more jarring than her gender, but since a modern audience doesn't bat an eye about this anymore, the writers made it a big deal and portrayed the male-only "scientific community" as outraged. Oy vey.

Honestly, those were small moments in the movie and they didn't detract *too much* except to pull the audience out of their suspension of disbelief; however, with Jungle Cruise, that disbelief is the thing that makes it work.

IMDB gives it 6.6. That's a point too high.

Watch: Sure, it has it's moments, just not many.

Re-watch: No. Re-watching Mummy or Pirates will be more satisfying.
