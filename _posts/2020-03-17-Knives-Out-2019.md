*A detective investigates the death of a patriarch of an eccentric, combative family.*

# [Knives Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8946378/)

![Knives Out Poster](/assets/2020/03/knives-out-2019.jpg){:.poster} The biggest disappointment I had with Knives Out was that halfway through the audience "knew" who did it. Now, I don't mind a Columbo-style murder mystery, but something felt off about that style with this movie because they told you who did it too late for Columbo-style but too early for anything else. Then I was thinking, *"Ok, I know who did it, but we still have over an hour left in the movie, so that character couldn't possibly have done it, so there's going to be a twist."*

Which kinda ruins the twist.

I did like the filming style and the sets and costumes were great. [Daniel Craig's](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/) southern drawl was cute, and all the actors did a great job. I enjoyed recognizing all the actors in this movie.

But some portions of the style were a bit over the top. The giant wheel of knives around everyone when being interviewed? Kitschy and kinda dumb. The *almost* bumbling cops? Dumb.

The twist of who really did it was pretty good.

Fun? Mostly. Well acted? Sure. Oscar worthy? No.

Watch? Yes. Re-watch? Prob not.
