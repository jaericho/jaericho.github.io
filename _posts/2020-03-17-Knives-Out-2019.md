Fun? Mostly. Well acted? Sure. Oscar worthy? No.

![Knives Out Poster](/assets/2020/03/knives-out-2019.jpg){:height="300px" align="right" border="1px"} The biggest disappointment I had with this movie was that halfway through the audience "knew" who did it. Now, I don't mind "Columbo" style murder mysteries, but something felt off about that style with this movie because they told you who did it too late for Columbo-style but too late for anything else. Then you're left thinking, *"Ok, I know who did it, but we still have over an hour left in the movie, so that character couldn't possibly have done it, so there's going to be a twist."*

Which kinda ruins the twist.

I did like the filming style and the sets and costumes were great. Daniel Craig's  southern drawl was kinda cute, and all the actors did a great job. I enjoyed recognizing all the actors in this movie.

But some portions of the style were a bit over the top: the giant wheel of knives around everyone when being interviewed. Kitchy and kinda dumb. The *almost* bumbling cops. Dumb. 

The twist of who really did it wasn't amazing, but pretty good.

Overall, it's a fun movie. Watch? Yes. Buy? No.
