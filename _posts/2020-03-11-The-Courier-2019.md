*A courier in London discovers that one of the packages she's transporting is a bomb.*

# [The Courier](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9207616/)

![The Courier (2019)](/assets/2020/03/the-courier-2019.jpg){:.poster} You'd probably have certain expectations and stereotypes when a movie poster features a sportsbike, but you'd be wrong with The Courier. It may feature the lovely [Olga Kurylenko](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1385871/) stratling a sportsbike in the poster, but the entire movie takes place mostly-motorcycleless in a parking garage and you know...it kinda works for me.

The story is pretty standard: The Hero is a low level tech that's going to testify against the murderous mobster, [Mr. Oldman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000198/). One of the cops assigned to protect him is dirty and now he's on the run getting help from a stranger who can kick-ass.

Oldman plays the villian quite villianously as well. The right balance of mobster and psychopath.

Olga (also in [The November Man]({% post_url 2014-09-02-The-November-Man-2014 %})) does a good job being the No-Name, off-the-grid, ex-Special Forces, courier unknowningly sent to deliver the bomb that was supposed to blow up our Hero. But is now tasked with keeping them both alive.

I have three critisms of the movie:
1. The Courier's backstory. meh, it could have been better. Leaving it a mystery would have been the best choice.
1. Fight scenes need to stop thinking that getting your head wrapped against concrete doesn't matter. Puh-lease. Any person would be seeing so many stars they could barely breathe. Same with head-butts. They just don't work for me in modern fight scenes.
1. The ending needed work. The twist was bog-standard and was cliched, and it was such a blatent *let's-leave-this-open-for-a-sequel* that it had no impact. I think movie endings would be better served if they just ended and retconned in a sequel later.

It's a decent but predictable action movie. High production value, villians are very villiany, good fight scenes (with minor critisisms). And I like movies that put the setting in one location and can make it work.
