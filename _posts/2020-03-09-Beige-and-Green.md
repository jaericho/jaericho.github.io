I repainted the office and removed the [blue walls]({% post_url 2015-02-02-TARDIS-Blue %}). I went back to [Accessible Beige]({% post_url 2020-02-11-Accessible-Beige %}) and added a accent wall.

I like this green but it's still not perfect. It needs to be a shade darker but I don't want it to be too muted. It still needs some *pop* to it.

But when I change my mind, I only have one wall to paint.
