I repainted the office and removed the blue walls. I went back to Accessible Beige and added a accent wall.

I like this green but it's still not perfect. It needs to be a shade darker but I don't want it to be too muted. It still needs some *pop* to it.

But when I change my mind, I only have to paint one wall.
