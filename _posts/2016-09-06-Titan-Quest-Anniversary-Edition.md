I put 100+ hours in to the original Titan Quest and I was quite excited when I received a free upgrade to the Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition.

# Titan Quest Anniversary Edition

TQAE combines TQ with the expansion Immortal Throne, and includes [hundreds of bug fixes and gameplay balances](http://titanquestgame.com/pcchangelog/TQ_AnniversaryEdition_FullChangelog.txt).

So I jumped in with a lot of enthusiasm and ticked up several more hours; however, nostalgia is a hell of a drug and all my rosy memories of TQ started to fade. I started to nitpick little things:

Damn, I have to pick up gold? No auto-loot?

Where is the loot filter?

Why do I have to drag components to my inventory to combine them? Can’t I combine them while they’re in the inventory?

Then I remembered there is a game where all of this was fixed: [Grim Dawn](http://grimdawn.com/).

Called the spiritual successor to Titan Quest, Crate Entertainment started GD by licencing the TQ engine, then proceeded to combine the great TQ multi-classing skill-trees with a good story and topped it off by building in a decade’s worth of ARPG improvements.

I hope TQAE will eventually be updated with some modern features of ARPGs. It’s still a fun game with a good storyline and fun skill-trees. It’s just that the edges are a little too rough. A little polish would extend the life of this great game.

UPDATE 2017-12-01: There is a new expansion for TQ, Ragnarok. It adds a new class and many QoL improvements like starting at lvl40 to get to the new content faster, semi-auto loot for gold, potions, and components, and probably more I haven’t found yet.
