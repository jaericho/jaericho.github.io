I still need Adobe Flash in 2021.

I have an old Cisco C240 server that is getting replaced this year, but the management console still uses Adobe Flash. For this case, I need to keep a VM with an old version of flash lying around to manage it.

1. Download flash from the Internet Archive. I read that V32.0.0.363 is the last version without the kill switch, so that may work.
   * <https://archive.org/download/flashplayerarchive/pub/flashplayer/installers/archive/>
2. Install the Pale Moon browser. <https://www.palemoon.org/>
3. Copy `libflashplayer.so` to `/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins` (on Ubuntu 20.04, I had to manually create this dir: `sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins`)
4. Pale Moon should find flash now.
