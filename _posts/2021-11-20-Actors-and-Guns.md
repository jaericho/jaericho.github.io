The whole [Alec Baldwin shooting a crew member](https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2021/10/21/alec-baldwin-accidentally-shot-and-killed-female-cinematographer-injured-director-on-movie-set/) on a movie set has me thinking...

How do actors handle the cognitive dissonance of gun handling in Hollywood? Every normal person going through firearm training is told to never point it at another person, but actors are told to not only point a gun at someone, but they also pull the trigger and then they see that no one dies from it.

At least cops know that when they pull the trigger, someone may die and they'll have to live with it. But actors go thru the same motions and they expect the opposite.

It seems to be cognitive dissonance. How do they handle it? (If they do at all?)
