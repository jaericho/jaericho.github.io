My thoughts on the Wonder Woman movie.

## Good
* Still maintained femininity.
* No angst-y whining.
* Theme music was awesome.

## Neutral
* Too long.
* Sex. (It didn't need to be there)
* Villain was kinda weak.

## Terrible
* Penis jokes.
* The crown was crooked in first battle.
* Soft KB doesn't disappear when she's typing on physical kb.
