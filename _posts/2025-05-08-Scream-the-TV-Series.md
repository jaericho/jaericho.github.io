*A serialized anthology series that follows a group of teenagers being targeted by a masked serial killer.*

![Scream TV Poster](/assets/2025/05/scream-tv-poster.jpg){:.poster}So I'm a sucker for the Scream franchise, but I had no idea that MTV made [Scream: The TV Series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3921180/) a decade ago. The show features a different Ghostface mask and a completely new setup, unrelated to the [movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/). While it does retain a few of familiar, self-referential lines about the slasher movie genre, this version plays things pretty straight. The killer stalks a group of teens and picks them off one by one—or maybe just one or two in the first season. Surprisingly, there isn't a lot of murder in this series considering it's a teenage slasher tv series.

Without spoiling it too much for myself, some things I've read say that season one is decent, season two is much better, and season three is a terrible soft-reboot. After watching season one, I'll agree that it is decent. It's not groundbreaking and the show sticks to the basics but it does the basics well. The show is well acted with only a few scenes that have stilted dialog.

I have started season two and the episode titles have me laughing to myself: [I Know What You Did Last Summer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119345/), [Psycho](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/), [Dawn of the Dead](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077402/), [Jeepers Creepers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0263488/), and [The Orphanage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464141/)[^1].

Watch: Yes—if you like the movies.

[^1]If this is a reference to the Spanish film, *El orfanato*, then I fully approve. *El orfanato* was one helluva movie with an ending you don't forget.
