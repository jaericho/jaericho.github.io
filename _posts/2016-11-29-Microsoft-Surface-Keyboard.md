For the longest time, my favorite keyboard was the [Apple keyboard](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MB110LL/B/apple-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-english-usa).

I loved the chiclet keys, the low profile, and the Apple aesthetics. However, it was always missing the 100% Windows integration. I became used to using the Option key for the Windows key, the missing print screen, and a few others caveats. Eventually, I worked around them, but I always maintained that if someone could make and Apple keyboard with Windows keys, it’d be the best Windows keyboard ever.

I think Microsoft finally did it with the [Surface Keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/accessories/surface-keyboard).

At $99, it’s a little spendy for a non-mechanical, wireless keyboard, so I’ll have to sit on it for a bit, but so far it seems to be the keyboard I’ve been searching for.
