I enjoyed Liam Neeson's new thriller.

It felt like a Jason Patterson bookmovie: The bad guys were psychotic. The good guy wasn't perfect, but he wasn't some woe-is-me, super-flawed, I'm-not-good-I'm-just-less-evil character.

Liam Neeson does a great job. He has just the right amount of grizzled, seen-it-all cop without overdoing it. The token black kid was kind of annoying, but he wasn't a deal breaker.

Like the last movie I saw, The November Man, this is a good movie, but nothing stood out about it to make it great. If you're a fan of Liam Neeson, see it.

P.S.: Just make sure you don't see it in a theater where they will come around and tell you to take your leg off the back of the seat in front of you during the climax of the movie, thus jarring you out of your engrossment and completely destroying the feel of the movie. I won't name any names (Carmike), but there appear to be some movie theaters that do that. (Carmike)
