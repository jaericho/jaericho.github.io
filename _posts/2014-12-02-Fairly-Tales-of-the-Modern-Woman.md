How do you tell a girl their expectations are too high? Don’t. You will never succeed.

Trying to talk a woman out of expecting a man to pay for the first dinner date, out of expecting a romantic marriage proposal, and out of expecting a diamond ring five-hundredths of a carat larger than her sister’s ring is something Sisyphus wouldn’t attempt. I should know. I attempted it. It’s amazing at the logical gymnastics played in her mind and amazing that I haven’t learned my lesson yet to keep my own mouth shut.

Here’s what I was told the other day *(with my thoughts)*: The guy should pay for the first date. She will offer to pay, but he should refuse. *(So it’s not really a *genuine* offer. Just a test.)* But if he accepts her offer than she’ll gladly pay. *(Bullshit, it won’t be gladly.)* Dutch is out of the question. Because. *(Yeah, because actual equality won’t be tolerated.)*

I was also told that diamonds are the only option. Moissanites are shit. Cubic Zirconia is shit. Diamonds are forever. *(I think she actually went into a brainwashed-like trance when she said ‘Diamonds are forever’. Her voice became a monotone, flat, robotic sound. Her eyes dilated as she stared off into space and repeated “Diamonds are forever.”)* Any resistance to the fact that diamonds aren’t worth the money tail spins into a discussion of blood diamonds. "Get conflict free diamonds!" *(Somehow she thought my problem with the overpriced, overhyped rocks peddled by a bunch of gangsters was that they were socially unjust. News flash: I don’t give a shit about diamonds, blood or not.)*

Next, I was told that any diamond ring bought needed to be .05 carats bigger than her sisters. *(The sister’s ring was 1.2 carat, so her’s needs to be 1.25 carat. /facepalm I hope she never finds out her sister’s ring was fake.)*

Finally, the conversation was summed up: She should be surprised during the proposal. *(It shouldn’t be a surprise because they should be discussing marriage and their roles before the engagement.)* But of course she’ll discuss marriage and roles with the guy beforehand! But that discussion isn’t a proposal. A surprise is needed for a proposal. A romantic surprise. *(But it’s not a surprise because...<interrupted>)* It should be a surprise!

Amazing thing #1: Mental Gymnastics.
Amazing thing #2: My inability to keep my big mouth shut.
Amazing thing #3: Talking to a modern woman about marriage and her expectations requirements is the biggest marriage killer on the planet. The more she spoke the more MGTOW I went.

Women, if you want guys to pony up and get hitched: **Shut. The. Hell. Up.**

Update 2014-12-08: [JudgyBitch](http://judgybitch.com/2014/12/02/why-men-should-never-pay-for-the-first-date/) had a post up on the 2nd for this very topic. She was probably writing it as I was floundering with my argument.
