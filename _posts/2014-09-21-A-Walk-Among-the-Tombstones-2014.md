# [A Walk Among the Tombstones](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365907/)

![pic](/assets/2014/09/a-walk-among-the-tombstones.jpg){:.poster} I enjoyed [Liam Neeson's](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000553/) new thriller. It felt like a Jason Patterson bookmovie: The bad guys were psychotic and evil, and the good guy wasn't perfect, but he wasn't some woe-is-me, super-flawed, I'm-not-good-I'm-just-less-evil character.

Liam Neeson does a great job. He has just the right amount of grizzled, seen-it-all cop without overdoing it. The token black kid was kind of annoying, but he wasn't a deal breaker.

Like the last movie I saw, The November Man, this is a good movie, but nothing stood out about it to make it great. If you're a fan of Liam Neeson, see it.

P.S.: Just make sure you don't see it in a theater *(Carmike)* where they will come around to and empty theater and tell you to take your leg off the back of the seat in front of you during *the* climax of the movie, thus jarring you out of your engrossment and completely destroying the feel of the movie. I won't name any names *(Carmike)*, but there appear to be some movie theaters that do that. *(Carmike)*
