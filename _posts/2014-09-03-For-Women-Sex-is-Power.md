[The Spearhead](http://www.the-spearhead.com/2014/09/03/the-jennifer-lawrence-hacks-and-sexual-capitalism/) has a deceptively simple yet excellent analysis into the Jennifer Lawrence leaked pics "scandal":

> "Good" sexuality is when a woman profits from it in one way or another...What’s most important is the principle: a man took hold of these pictures without paying for them, and many men have had access to the material without Ms. Lawrence having first had the opportunity to capitalize on her sexuality.
>
> Feminists see it as a theft of sexual capital, and to them this is one of the greatest sins a man can commit. Sexuality is the currency feminists trade in, so any restrictions on its use are violently opposed even as they push for the most draconian of laws to protect those who own it.

It can’t be more plainly written than this: For women, sex is power.
