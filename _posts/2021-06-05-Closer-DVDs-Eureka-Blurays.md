*Whomever authored the DVD Box Set for The Closer should be punished.*

## [The Closer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458253/)

The Closer with [Kyra Sedgwick](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001718/) and [J.K. Simmons](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0799777/) is an excellent show. I love all the characters. From the hilarious *Flynn-and-Provenza-get-into-trouble* episodes, to the dramatic scenes with some great emotional acting by [Raymond Cruz](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0190441). I really wish TNT (or whomever) would put out the Blu-rays, but that doesn't seem like it's going to happen. So, I broke down and bought the DVDs thinking, *"What the hell, at least they'll be legit and the quality should be better than \*cough\**".

Wow, was I wrong. Whomever authored these DVDs did a terrible job. Each disc has 4 or 5 episodes squeezed into a **single-layer** (4.7GB) DVD. That means, on the 4 episode discs, a 45 minute episode is squeezed into 1 GB, and the 5 episode discs have each episode is squeezed into 800 MBs. This makes all the episodes look fuzzy even for a DVD. It's absolute horseshit.

Do not buy. They're a waste of money, just get them from *\*cough\**.

## [Eureka](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796264/)

Finding the Eureka Complete Series blu-ray box set for less than $30 was quite the find. It's an excellent series that has held up well over the years even after it's soft-reboot in the later seasons.

### Pros

* Great show.
* Inexpensive.
* Looks good in HD.
* Episodes are in order after ripping with MakeMKV, unlike some shows. (*\*cough\** Big Bang Theory *\*cough\**)
* Many commentary tracks.

### Cons

* Eps look good but are a little grainy under scrutiny.
* Some Commentary tracks have a horrible audio buzz.
