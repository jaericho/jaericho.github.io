Whoever authored the DVD Box Set for The Closer should be punished.

## [The Closer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458253/)

The Closer with [Kyra Sedgwick](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001718/) and [J.K. Simmons](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0799777/) is an excellent show. I love all the characters. From the hilarious *Flynn-and-Provenza-get-into-trouble* episodes, to the dramatic scenes with some great emotional acting by [Raymond Cruz](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0190441). I really wish TNT (or whomever) would put out the Blu-rays, but that doesn't seem like it's going to happen. So, I broke down and bought the DVDs thinking, *"What the hell, at least they'll be legit and the quality should be better than *\*cough\**".

Wow, was I wrong. Who ever authored these DVDs did a terrible job. Each disc has 4 or 5 episodes squeezed onto a **single-layer** (4.7GB) DVD. That means, on the 4 episode discs, a 45 minute episode is squeezed into 1 GB, 
and the 5 episode discs have each episode is squeezed into 800 MBs. This makes all the episodes look fuzzy even for a DVD. It's absolute horseshit. 

Do not buy. They're a waste of money, just get them from *\*cough\**.

## [Eureka](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796264/)

Finding the Eureka Complete Series blu-ray box set for less than $30 was quite the find. It's an excellent series that even held up well under it's soft-reboot in the later seasons. The episodes look good in HD, they're in order after ripping them with MakeMKV (unlike other shows *\*cough\** Big Bang Theory *\*cough\**), and there are a slew of commentaries and podcasts as audio tracks.
