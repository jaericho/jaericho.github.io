Bitvise has to have the best installer I have seen in a long time.

Everything is on one screen: the EULA, upgrade vs. new instance, the open when finished option. Everything. None of the endless wizard crap of Next, Next, Next, Next, Next, Next, Next, Next, Next, Next, Next, Next, Accept, Install...Finish.

Fan*fucking*tastic Bitvise.
