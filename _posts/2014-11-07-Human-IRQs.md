From Hertiste via [Vox](http://alphagameplan.blogspot.com/2014/11/avoid-human-black-hole.html), here is some useful information about attention-whores.

> If a woman asks you a question, then can't even manage to listen to any answer in more depth than “yes” or “no”, you probably don't want to take the risk of involving yourself with her. I, personally, don't waste my time on attention whores, as there are few things on the planet less interesting than human black holes.

I'd call them human IRQs, except IRQs are useful in the computer world. And I'm a complete geek and probably shouldn't do something like that.

I've learned about this quite recently: Within the past year, I met a woman that would look me in the eyes, listen to me, and wouldn't interrupt me when I was speaking. It was quite an eye opener. The respect shown to me was incredible. I've now compared that to the status quo of my interactions with women (including my cousins and family members) that consists mostly of constant interruption and my conclusion is I am becoming intolerant of people that refuse to let anyone finish a sentence. I no longer feel that conversations have to be a battles of wills; a test of who can get their opinions out as quickly and as loud as possible before the other person speaks. Of course, reminding women that polite company doesn't interrupt when the other person is speaking will only get you the cliched claim that they aren't being rude, they're boisterous, strong-willed, and passionate.

Sorry sweetheart, you're rude, loud, and obnoxious, and you're definitely not worth my time when others have proven to be much more deserving.
