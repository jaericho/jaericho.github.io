*Airline hijackers vs. vampire mom.*

![Blood Red Sky poster](/assets/2021/08/blood-red-sky-2021.jpg){:.poster} [Blood Red Sky](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6402468/) isn't complicated: hijackers pick the wrong flight when they hijack a plane with a vampire mom and her young (human) son trying to reach New York to get some sort of operation. The premise is crazy but it's executed well and the movie more or less works.

[Peri Baumeister](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3973870/) does a great job as the vampire mom trying desperately to keep the monster bottled up. Her maternal instincts kept her sanity for most of the movie but you can tell it's a losing struggle.

I did like that the vampire were very monster-like and they took on the classic Nosferatu features. These aren't [Blade](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611/) or [True Blood](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844441/) extras. However, the movie did use the ol' *UV-rays-are-just-as-good-as-the-sun* trope. It's annoying but forgivable as it's seldomly used.

IMDB gives it 6.1. That's a fair rating.

Watch: Yes, if you like action-horror movies.

Re-watch: Probably not.
