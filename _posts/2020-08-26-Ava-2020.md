*Kill. Or Be Killed.*

# [Ava]([https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8784956/])

![Ava (2020) poster](/assets/2020/08/ava-2020.jpg){:.poster} I was excited when I saw the the poster for this movie: [Collin Farrell](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0268199/), [John Malkovich](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000518/), and [Geena Davis](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000133/), is quite the cast[^1]. After watching it I have mixed emotions about this movie, and unfortunately, they lean towards the negative. The action sequences are pretty good. Decent fighting and some fun martial arts moves. It's just that they are too far apart to be enjoyable. The rest of the movie is drama and worse, it's annoying drama.

Ava is the top assassin for the mysterious *Management*. Except she can't help but break Management's rules. What rules does she break? She talks to her targets before she kills them and asks them what they've done to deserve their fate. Apparently this is too much for a global assassination organization to bear, so Management sabotages Ava's next mission to get her killed on the job. Of course, it doesn't work so now Ava must fight to survive her former employer.

I just layed out the first and last 15 minutes of the movie. The middle is comprised of boring, annoying boyfriend/family drama. Yikes.

Watch? Only if you're looking for this type of movie.

Re-watch? No.

[^1]: I didn't even recognize [Ioan Gruffudd](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0344435/) at first. He should be in the list too.
