*Kill. Or Be Killed.*

# [Ava]([https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8784956/])

![Ava (2020) poster](/assets/2020/08/ava-2020.jpg){:.poster} I was excited when I saw the the poster for this movie: [Collin Farrell](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0268199/), [John Malcovich](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000518/), and [Geena Davis](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000133/), is quite the cast[^1]. After watching it I have mixed emotions about this movie, and unfortunately, they lean towards the negative. The action sequences are pretty good. Decent fighting and some fun martial arts moves. It's just that they are too far apart to be enjoyable. The rest of the movie is drama and worse, it's annoying drama.

Ava is an assassin for the mysterious *Management*. Except she can't help but break Management's rules. What rule does she break? She talks to her targets before she kills them and asks them what they've done to deserve their fate. Apparently this is too much for Management and messes with one of her missions and try to get her killed on the job. Of course, it doesn't work so now she has to fight to survive her former employers.

I just layed out the first and last 15 minutes of the movie. The middle is comprised of boring, annoying boyfriend/family drama.

Watch? Maybe. It's not terrible, but not great.

Re-watch? No.

[^1]: I didn't even recognize [Ioan Gruffudd](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0344435/) at first. He should be in the list too.
