The title doesn't mean anything. This is just a blog, mostly filled with bad movie reviews and ranting about stupid bugs I encounter.

I have wanted to try a static website generator for a while. My Wordpress blog became so bloated that it was downloading 6MB of data to load a single, pictureless, "About" page.

I don't want to host my own yet, so I'm trying a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) hosted [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) blog.

I've tried several static website generators and they all seem very complicated. I just want a statically generated website using markdown or something simple with nice typography.
