# Expanding vmware drive error

After recieving and error of "invalid operation for device '0'" I was able to increase the drive size by going back to the old flash based FlexUI of vcenter.

# Ivanti and AV scanning

It appears that Ivanti isn't smart enough to make sure it's scheduled AV scans don't overlap each other.

# Keychron keyboard K3 v2

Pros:

* Schexy
* easy to clean
* **very** easy to type on
* win and mac options
* wired and wireless

Cons:

* a little *too* sensitive, but I may get used to it.
* too many backlight options. all i need is on, dim, and off. but there is a lock function.

# Swapping an i5-7600 with a Ryzen 5600x

Wow, that went very smoothly. I replaced an i5-7600 with a Ryzen 5600x and Windows didn't even bat an eye. I lucked out that it was just the board that died and not the video card, and the DDR4-2600 worked as well. It was just a mobo and cpu that needed to be swapped and it worked like a charm.
