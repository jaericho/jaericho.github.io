# Expanding vmware drive error

After recieving and error of "invalid operation for device '0'" I was able to increase the drive size by going back to the old flash based FlexUI of vcenter.

However, I wonder if PowerCLI would have done it too: https://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/b8q9s4/workaround_for_invalid_operation_for_device_0/

# Swapping an i5-7600 with a Ryzen 5600x

Wow that went very smoothly. I replaced an i5-7600 with a Ryzen 5600x and Windows didn't even bat an eye. I lucked out that it was just the motherboard that died and not the video card. The DDR4-2600 worked as well. I swapped the mobo and cpu and it worked like a charm.
