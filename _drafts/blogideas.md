# Expanding vmware drive error

After receiving and error of "invalid operation for device '0'" I was able to increase the drive size by going back to the old flash based FlexUI of vcenter.

However, I wonder if PowerCLI would have done it too: https://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/b8q9s4/workaround_for_invalid_operation_for_device_0/

# Ivanti and AV scanning

It appears that Ivanti isn't smart enough to make sure it's scheduled AV scans don't overlap each other.

# Python Benchmarks with the M1

A friend of mine is taking some sort of data analytics class and he's learning python. I'm not sure what is all involved with it. But he needed an upgrade from his i5-4690 4c/4t machine, so he gave me a call and my kneejerk reaction was to point him towards the 5600x. A solid, modern, 6c/12t CPU that will get him a lot of bang for his buck. And it did give a great performance lift. One of his jobs went from 7 hours to 3.5 hours of processing time. Up next he's going to water cool it, and do a slight overclock to squeeze out a bit better performance, but so far he is enjoying the long delayed upgrade.

Should I have told him my fanless Macbook Air with the M1 did it in 2.75 hours?

# Windows 11

So far, i'm not hating Windows 11. After I upgraded at work, Win11 cleared up several bugs of mine and at least *feels* faster than Win10.

I was experiencing a bad bug in Office 2016 that would make the calendar in Outlook very slow and after an in-place upgrade to Win11 the issue is gone.
