The essential list of Big Bang Theory episodes.

# Big Bang Theory
![Big Bang Theory Poster Season 1](/assets/2020/06/big_bang_theory_poster.jpg){:.poster} It's a guilty pleasure, but I still enjoy [The Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/), and while it's far from perfect[^1], I believe cutting out the fluff would make it better, so here is my list of essential episodes. At first, I just wanted to deal with Leonard and Penny's relationship but I can't cut out all the Sheldon and Amy related episodes. So I decided to keep just the important relationship and character growth episodes for all the characters.

Of course, I'll have to rewatch the series for a third time after I complete this list so I may be completely sick of it by the third time through.

## Season 1
* Ep01 Pilot
* Ep04 Luminous Fish Effect (Introduction of Mary, Sheldon's mother.)
* Ep05 Hamburger Postulate
* Ep06 Middle Earth Paradigm (Leonard and Penny's first kiss.)
* Ep08 Grasshopper Experiment (Introduction of Raj's parents.)
* Ep11 Pancake Batter Anomaly (Introduction of Soft Kitty.)
* Ep13 Bat Jar Conjecture (TV's Blossom is mentioned.)
* Ep15 maybe (Introduction of Sheldon’s sister.)
* Ep17 First Date (Leonard and Penny's first date.)

## Season 2
* Ep01 The Bad Fish Paradigm (Leonard and Penny's first date pt 2)
* Ep02 The Codpiece Topology (Leonard and Penny break up.)
* *Ep03 The Barbarian Sublimation (maybe, Penny’s mmorpg addiction and relationship to Sheldon.)*
* *Ep04 The Griffin Equivalency (maybe, there are some funny jokes.)*
* *Ep05 The Euclid Alternative (maybe, Sheldon’s driving lessons.)*
* Ep06 The Cooper-Nowitski Theorem (Second Barenaked Ladies song.)
* Ep07 The Panty Pinata Polarization (Sheldon and Penny fight.)

[^1]: Sheldon's hatred of Babylon 5, calling it's writing derivitive, is reason enough to never watch BBT, and proof enough that the writers didn't know what they were talking about. They just looked up pop culture references and threw them into the show.
