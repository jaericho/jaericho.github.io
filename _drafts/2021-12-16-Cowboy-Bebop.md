*A ragtag crew of bounty hunters chases down the galaxy's most dangerous criminals. They'll save the world--for the right price.*

Right off the bat I'm going to throw this out there: I never even knew Cowboy Bebop was being made into a live action series until the trailer dropped a few weeks ago, so I missed all the online controversy that surrounded its development. *thank goodness* So because of that, I can offer an unbiased fan's opinion: They did good with making it look like the Bebop universe, but they screwed up the writing that the show sucks. I'm on episode 6 and I can barely get thru it.

I didn't even know there was controversy surrounding it and at this point I don't even want to know what it was. The Critical Drinker has a video about some of it.

The aesthetics of the show aren't bad. They kept the design of the ships, gates, the general feel of the shittiness of the universe and it kinda worked. But they made the show rated R and I don't think they should have gone that route. The writers should have stuck with PG13 instead.
