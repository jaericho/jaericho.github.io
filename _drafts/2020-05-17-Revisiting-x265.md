I thought I knew what I was doing with Handbrake encoding.

And now I don't know what to think... I always thought that video encoding was a fairly simple trade off of **Quality, Speed, Filesize: Pick Two**. So I would choose the best reasonable quality for the video, and encode as slowly as reasonable to get the smallest filesize. However, after some testing I have to throw all that thinking out.

I recently bought the [Daredevil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3322312/) blu-ray and decided to rip them with [x265](https://infogalactic.com/info/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) as my Plex server is more powerful for transcoding and more of my client devices can do x265 natively.

I used [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) for the tests, and I started with the built-in preset of `H.265 MKV 1080p30` and then adjusted it closer to my normal settings:

* Removed the deinterlace filters.
* Removed audio tracks for the tests.
* Set the framerate to `Same as Source/variable`.
* The preset also included `strong-intra-smoothing=0:rect=0:aq-mode=1`, so I kept those settings.

Then I just re-encoded the same chapter at different speeds.

Here are the results for Daredevil S01E01 Chapter 3:

I have no idea how or why *increasing* the encoding speed consistantly results in the smaller filesize, but it does.

I encoded the entire season with these settings and I like the results. They look much better than the previous copy I had at 720p.
