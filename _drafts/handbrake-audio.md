The average filesize is 1.4GB.

and about 400MB of that is audio.

For audio I usually do [AAC](https://infogalactic.com/info/Advanced_Audio_Coding) (Quality 8) and that made S01E01's audio track 406MB. Re-encoding the DTS-MA track in [FLAC](https://infogalactic.com/info/FLAC) would make the audio track 450MB, so for not much more filesize I could get lossless audio. I'll need to see what my client devices do with FLAC. This also means that Quality 8 might be overkill on the bitrate, but Quality 5 only reduces it a few MB. However, I can't find any good info on the quality settings for AAC in Handbrake.
