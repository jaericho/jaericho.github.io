The essential list of Big Bang Theory episodes.

# Big Bang Theory

![Season 1 poster](/assets/2020/06/big_bang_theory_poster.jpg){:.poster} It's a guilty pleasure, but I still enjoy [The Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/), and while it's far from perfect[^1], I believe cutting out the fluff would make it better, so here is my list of essential episodes.

At first, I just wanted to deal with Leonard and Penny's relationship, but I can't cut out all the Sheldon/Amy or Howard/Bernadette episodes, so I decided to keep just the important relationship and character growth episodes for all the characters. And the episodes that include Zach.

Of course, I'll have to rewatch the series for a third time after I complete this list, so I may be completely sick of the show by the third time through.

## Season 1

[^1]: Sheldon's distain of [Babylon 5](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105946/), calling it's writing derivitive, is reason enough to never watch BBT, and proof that the writers didn't know what they were talking about. They just looked up geek pop-culture and threw references  into the show.
