*A list of complaints and growing pains from an old Windows user to a new Mac user.*

After some light usage for a few months, here my some of my complaints for MacOS.

* The Activity Monitor is a very poor substitute for Task Manager.
* Windows' Explorer is easier to move files around than Finder.
* OneDrive can take over all the major places in the users' home directory (Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc...); however, iCloud Drive just seems content to exist side by side. This makes it very confusing as to where files exist.
* MacOS 12 apparently broke Unraid's TimeMachine hosting capability. Bummer as I was looking forward to trying that out.
